# FruitNinja
This repository contains two versions of a custom Fruit Ninja game built using Python's Turtle library.
The Non-AI Version is playable with the mouse. Fruits and bombs follow parabolic arcs. It includes slicing animation, score system, and medal rewards with custom themes and backgrounds.
The AI Version uses a Q-learning agent to control the sword, it tracks and slices multiple fruits while avoiding bombs. Implements a 7x7 grid environment for the AI, and visualizes the AI’s Q-table and tracks training rewards over time.

(Note: the q_table was not added to the repository due to size constraints, however it can be generated on another PC when the training file is run.)
